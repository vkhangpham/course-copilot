coverage:
  description: |
    Measures whether the lecture spans the core Database Systems pillars (relational
    foundations, transactional integrity, and modern/distributed extensions) highlighted
    in PLAN Phase B. Lectures should connect multiple focus areas rather than fixating
    on a single topic.
  pass_threshold: 0.75
  checklist:
    - "Relational model fundamentals and SQL-query fluency are mentioned explicitly."
    - "Transactions, recovery, or concurrency control trade-offs are discussed."
    - "Modern or distributed database case studies (e.g., Spanner, Aurora, NewSQL) appear."

grounding:
  description: |
    Ensures every lecture anchors claims in canonical sources, citations, and the
    handcrafted world-model lineage (authors, papers, or timeline entries). Reviewers
    should be able to trace each major assertion to a cited artefact.
  pass_threshold: 0.8
  checklist:
    - "Required primary sources (e.g., Codd 1970, System R 1976) are referenced."
    - "At least one primary paper, timeline, or dataset citation is included inline."
    - "Learning objectives or timeline events are tied back to cited provenance."

pedagogy:
  description: |
    Evaluates whether the lecture scaffolds learning with objectives, assessments,
    worked examples, and practice prompts per Phase E's rubric guidance.
  pass_threshold: 0.7
  checklist:
    - "Explicit learning objectives and assessment signals are stated."
    - "Includes a worked example, walkthrough, or review question."
    - "Highlights schema practice, locking drills, or reflection prompts students can attempt."
