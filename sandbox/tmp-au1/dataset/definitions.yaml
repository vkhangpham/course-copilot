definitions:
  - id: def-transaction
    concept: transaction_management
    statement: "A transaction is a sequence of operations that executes atomically and durably, appearing indivisible to other concurrent units of work."
    citation: gray-reuter-1993
    source_excerpt: "A transaction transforms the database from one consistent state to another, preserving ACID."
  - id: def-serializability
    concept: concurrency_control
    statement: "Serializability is the isolation property whereby concurrent execution produces a result equivalent to some serial order of the same transactions."
    citation: bernstein-1987
    source_excerpt: "Schedules are serializable if they are conflict-equivalent to a serial schedule."
  - id: def-wal
    concept: recovery
    statement: "Write-ahead logging (WAL) mandates that log records describing changes be flushed to stable storage before the corresponding data pages."
    citation: aries-1992
    source_excerpt: "ARIES enforces WAL to guarantee redo information is durable before dirty pages reach disk."
  - id: def-btree
    concept: indexing_strategies
    statement: "A B+-tree index stores sorted keys in internal nodes and data pointers in leaves, supporting logarithmic search and range scans."
    citation: graefe-1994
    source_excerpt: "B+-trees remain the default choice for disk-resident indexes due to their fan-out and range efficiency."
  - id: def-cap
    concept: consistency_models
    statement: "The CAP theorem states that in the presence of a network partition, a distributed system must trade off availability against strong consistency."
    citation: brewer-cap-2000
    source_excerpt: "You can only choose two of Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance."
  - id: def-truetime
    concept: distributed_transactions
    statement: "TrueTime exposes bounded clock uncertainty, allowing Spanner to assign globally meaningful timestamps for external consistency."
    citation: spanner-2012
    source_excerpt: "Spanner waits out the uncertainty interval to ensure transactions commit in timestamp order."
  - id: def-mvcc
    concept: mvcc
    statement: "MVCC maintains multiple committed versions so readers obtain snapshot-consistent data without blocking writers."
    citation: bernstein-1987
    source_excerpt: "Multi-version systems keep prior versions and let read-only transactions proceed without locks, cleaning up versions lazily."
  - id: def-cost-model
    concept: cost_models
    statement: "Cost models approximate I/O, CPU, and memory consumption of candidate plans using statistics to guide join ordering."
    citation: volcano-1994
    source_excerpt: "Volcano enumerates plans using dynamic programming with estimated costs derived from histograms and cardinality formulas."
  - id: def-governance
    concept: governance_lineage
    statement: "Lineage captures how datasets, transforms, and outputs relate so instructional materials can cite provenance."
    citation: google-f1-2013
    source_excerpt: "F1 maintains metadata for each record to provide auditability and trace query outputs back to the source tables."
