# ccopilot-9wk · Notebook/README coordination plan

- Purpose: ensure notebooks/README/test files currently reserved by BlueCastle/GreenStone get released once their Phase F patches land so others can proceed.
- Actions:
  1. Monitor Agent Mail threads (`ccopilot-5fr`, `ccopilot-ofe`, `ccopilot-m6z`) for release notices.
  2. If releases aren’t confirmed within the next cycle, ping BlueCastle/GreenStone with the current bead IDs and ask for ETA/temporary release.
  3. Document release status here and in beads so everyone knows when the surfaces are free.
