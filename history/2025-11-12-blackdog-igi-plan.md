# Plan – ccopilot-igi (Add NotebookPublisher tests)

1. Stage existing `tests/test_notebook_publisher.py` helper to the repo (currently untracked even though it validates key code paths).
2. Run the targeted pytest slice to make sure NotebookPublisher coverage passes locally.
3. Commit the test + update beads.
4. Communicate and close the bead.
